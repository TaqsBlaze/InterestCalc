# InterestCalc
A python+Tk program to calculate interests

the program still has  a few minor bugs
in attempt to add the thousand separator when your total gets to a thousand
it can not be converted back to float
example: 1,000.00 will generate an error
*Invalid literal for float(): 1,000.00*
becouse i want the results to be in 2 decimal places
